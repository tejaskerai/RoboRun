# RoboRun
## Overview
This project was created as part of my Java module in University. It involved creating a Platformer game similar to Donkey Kong.

## Main features of the game

- At the top of the screen there is a menu, where you can **change levels at any point** in the game and **change the speed of character**
- For each level in the game there is a **distinct background sound**
- There are **distinct sounds for each item that the player can pick up**, this includes the heart, diamond, and enemy. Also**, when transitioning to the next level there is a different sound**
- Below the menu bar, there are **options to pause, resume, restart and quit the game**, the restart button resets the position of the characters in the current level
- The **enemies in the game move automatically**, this is done using collision detection and adds some difficulty to the levels
- The **value of the lives carries on to the next level**
